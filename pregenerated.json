        "body": "<br />The housing benefit system has been underfunded and underburdened in recent years. Despite giving an average of \u00a382 a week to the average family of 3,000, it is now estimated that the average person in England is expected to pay \u00a323,000 for housing, and yet are not given a basic income.<br /><br />This has been a major issue for many in the housing sector, and made it very difficult for the government to tackle the problem.<br /><br />It is time for the government to review the housing benefit system and make it more accessible, accountable and accountable to the public.<br />"

Scotland is being abused by third parties.<br /><br />They are campaigning for a constitutional vote and have only a minority in favour of a Yes vote. Why is this happening? Why are people being treated like second class citizens.<br /><br />There has been a huge amount of abuse of the law in Scotland, the law is being used to silence and silence the voices of the majority and the majority is being ignored.<br /><br />This is not an open petition but a matter for the Scottish Parliament which has a duty to respect the law as it stands. We can get a majority of MPs to respect the laws in Scotland and have a say in the UK.<br />"
